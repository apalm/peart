# Peart

Peart is a simple drum machine built with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and the [Web Audio API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/). It uses [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Storage#localStorage) to persist settings from the previous session.
